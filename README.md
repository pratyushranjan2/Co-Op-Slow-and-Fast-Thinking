# Co-Operative and Competitive Games

Two teams of pacman compete against each other to collect maximum rewards in least amount of time. 

Currently, there are 3 types of pacman agents, - 
1. Faster S1 agent (built using Tabular RL)
2. Slower S2 agent (butilt using Monte Carlo Tree Search)
3. Blocking Agent: These agents block the agents of opponent teams to prevent them from collecting rewards.
More agents will be developed subsequently.

To run the simulation, the shell script ""run.sh"" can be used.
